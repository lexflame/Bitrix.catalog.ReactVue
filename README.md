üõçÔ∏è Bitrix D7 Vue.js Catalog Component (AJAX + Responsive + Smart Filters)
This is a highly optimized AJAX-based product catalog component for Bitrix D7, designed for modern eCommerce projects. It leverages Vue.js, jQuery, and Bootstrap 4 to deliver a fast, interactive, and mobile-friendly user experience with composite site support.

üîß Key Features
AJAX Filtering by Properties:
Filter products using smart checkboxes for custom properties (e.g., color, size), including integration with trade offers (SKU) via CML2_LINK.

Sorting Options:
Users can sort by:

Name (A‚ÄìZ / Z‚ÄìA)

Price (ascending/descending)

Popularity (based on the SORT field)

Pagination & Lazy Load:
Combines traditional server-side pagination (CIBlockElement::GetList) with infinite scrolling via IntersectionObserver.

URL Filter Sync:
Filter and sorting state is synchronized with the URL using history.pushState, allowing users to bookmark or share exact catalog states.

Session Storage Support:
Selected filters are stored in sessionStorage to persist state during navigation or page refresh.

Responsive Layout (Bootstrap 4):
Mobile-first grid layout using Bootstrap 4 ensures seamless UX across all devices.

D7 Core & Clean Output:
AJAX responses are handled using Bitrix D7 core classes (Application::getInstance()->getContext()->getResponse()), ensuring clean and standard-compliant JSON output.

High Performance:
Fully compatible with Bitrix composite mode, supporting both managed and unmanaged caching where applicable.
